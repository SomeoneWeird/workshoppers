NodeSchool Workshoppers
=======================

**A central catalog of existing, planned and requested workshoppers**

#### Looking for workshopper lessons?

Find lessons to take by [filtering the issue list](https://github.com/nodeschool/workshoppers/issues?labels=status%3Acompleted).

#### Suggesting a new lesson?

Create a new issue explaining what you would like to see covered. If you're familiar with the topic, providing an outline of exercises is a great start, too.

Once the suggestion is posted, someone will tag it with [status:requested](https://github.com/nodeschool/workshoppers/issues?labels=status%3Arequested) and anyone looking for workshoppers to work on will be able to find it.

#### Working on a lesson?

Check the list to see whether there's an existing issue for the topic. If there is no existing issue, create a new one. Then post the link to your repo and someone will add the [status:in progress](https://github.com/nodeschool/workshoppers/issues?labels=status%3Ain+progress) tag to the issue. Make sure to post again once it is in a usable state.
